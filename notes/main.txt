Main Design

Public Functions:
1. Each public function must be named with the `wimey_` prefix.
2. Function names must use snake_case.
3. Each public function should have comments explaining what it does and what it returns, placed before the declaration.
4. Default return values should be `WIMEY_SUCCESS` and `WIMEY_ERR`.

Internal Functions:
1. Internal functions must be named with a double underscore prefix (`__`).
2. Internal functions should be declared as `static` where possible.
